The behavior of one particular staff member was unacceptable and greatly impacted my overall experience.

During my visit, I encountered a Indian girl staff member who consistently shouted at customers and demonstrated a complete refusal to provide assistance. This behavior was disrespectful and created an unwelcoming atmosphere for everyone seeking help. It is essential for employees to maintain a professional demeanor and treat customers with respect, regardless of the circumstances.

Moreover, this indian girl staff member's refusal to assist customers was deeply concerning. When approached with inquiries and requests for guidance, they dismissed customers' concerns and failed to fulfill their responsibilities. This lack of assistance not only hindered the drop-off process but also showed a disregard for customer satisfaction and the smooth operation of the facility.

It is crucial for the management of this parcel drop-off point to address these issues promptly. Customer service should be a top priority, and employees should be trained to handle inquiries and provide assistance in a respectful and helpful manner. Creating a positive and supportive environment is vital to ensure a satisfactory experience for all customers.

I sincerely hope that the necessary steps will be taken to improve the behavior and attitude of staff members at this parcel drop-off point. Customers deserve to be treated with professionalism, courtesy, and prompt assistance. I encourage the management to conduct training sessions and enforce policies that promote a customer-centric approach.

Please note that this review is based on my personal experience, and it is my hope that sharing this feedback will contribute to the improvement of the service provided at this facility.",1689576673,en,negative,0.4391093850135803

The nozzles however aren't too friendly for motorcyclist especially kapchais because the fuel will just rush out like waterfalls. This could lead for overspills, primarily for those with trigger-happy fingers.
Depress the trigger lightly, about 5mm travel to prevent any surge.

Smartphone's reception here is quiet good. Suffice to perform digital transaction via ""Setel"" or just sending Whatsapp informing your whereabout to your relatives.
I use Yes4G network. If such a rare Telco is available here, I guess ""The Big Three"" will be here as well.

Note : ""The Big Three"" refers to Maxis, Celcom & Digi

Update : ""Although mobile reception is practically good outside, but once you get inside the enclosed store, you'll find it's a struggle to pay anything via e-wallets, including their very-own Setel app. This is possibly due to the fact the tints on the windows might have some metal contents in it. All wireless tech uses radio signal ; and our phones particularly connected to the towers via UHF-band. This highly-rebounce  UHF signal should go through glass window, but if the windows are too thick or coated with traces of metal, those signal won't get through. If the owner of the station read this, may I suggest removing the metallized tints, or to save cost ; create an opening of at least 30cm in close proximity to the cashier. This is because UHF wavelength is 1-ft(almost equals to 30cm) and get lesser as the frequency increases. So theoretically, any opening with 30cm by 30cm, should improve mobile connectivity indoors. Another solution is to employ 'signal-repeaters'. But that will cost a fortune to own one.

If not because of petrol run down, I will not visit, thinking give them a chance but their machine out there wasn't working. Im worried that my card will be charged twice. So Try to get the staff to help, but they were so impatient. One of the staff raised his voice to me when they can't solve my issue. The other when I asked for help just ignored. In the end, I pumped RM6 just enough for me to go another petrol station. I hope the staff got enough training. Your customer is not very satisfied with your service.

Today this Petronas outlet has become a popular spot mostly among motorists and is also a gazetted filling station for police vehicles. The police presence also helps to make this fuel station a safer place.

There used to be a manual car wash service in the early 2000s but the business has long ceased operations.

Its staff are well trained and courteous. Apart from the Mesra convenience store there is a Maybank and a CIMB ATM machine inside the premises. You can also top up your Touch N' Go card here and buy newspapers.

Petronas Jalan 222 also accepts cash, credit/debit cards and e-wallet payments for fuel and store purchases.

You can find freshly made, prepacked breakfast items like nasi lemak, fried rice, fried noodles and traditional Malay cakes in the morning. Local tidbits like muruku, rempeyek and cookies are also available here.

Long story short, there was an oil spill in one of the empty spaces to park and fill up petrol.

Take note that there was no warning cones, or any employee at the site when this occurred. This shows the level of negligence for the employees of this branch. When i politely entered the building to enquire for the manager, one of the employees called the manager and when I wanted to greet him and explain the situation he just walked pass me and immediately went to the scene. After that he suddenly disappeared only to finally ""AFTYER THE ACCIDENT OCCURED !!!"" To put the danger cone to warn others of the spill. When I enquired if there is a process I should undergo to assist me in this situation, he snapped at me by saying ""Kalau macam ni bukan masalah saya!"" This significantly angered me.

My question is, is this the quality of PETRONAS Employees that are available today in this major branch?

They blame me for not putting the nozzle correctly? WTH?

This is suppose to be your equipment problem, Not my problem. I’m not new driver on the road. I’ve pump on my own for countless time for years.

It’s simple, just look at all your station and tell me which station the floor with oil stain. Only station 14 with oil stain. I’m definitely not the first one who experience this nightmare… otherwise the stain won’t be dark and even before I pump I already see some oil on the floor. Side note, I’m using Setel to pay, so I paid first before I get down to my car and notice the petrol stain there.

UPDATE: made a complaint at the counter, luckily there is an uncle who are working on maintenance. He demonstrated to me that the pump will stop when it detected pressure in front of the nozzle.

As she held me, she immediately apologised and said she's adding another RM10 of petrol for me (RM5 extra) so i that I forgive her and just go. As if she knew she did something wrong.

I was very furious and lectured her that if she ever do this again i will report and have her fired. She's a petite lady in her 40's and have a sad face, if its not because i pity her losing her job i would't let her get away with this.

Im still furious as she might still resume conning other people but I am also empathetic to not report to management as i know it might be her only rezeki and source of income to survive so I wouldn't bother spilling her name.

We were completely shocked as we were only having a conversation and not shouting. If there was an issue, she could have approached us politely instead of creating a scene and embarrassing us in front of other customers.

I am writing to express my disappointment with my recent visit to  your stations (R & R Kinrara- Kesas Highway). This was my first time stopping by this particular Petronas location, and unfortunately, it was not a pleasant experience.

1. No Lights and Air Conditioning: The store was extremely dark, with no lights or air conditioning on. This made it very difficult to navigate and created an uncomfortable shopping environment. It felt as though the store was closed.
2. Customer Service: The staff, who appeared to be more engaged in their personal conversations, displayed a lack of customer service attitude. There was no effort made to assist or engage with customers.
3. The location of this station is excellent, but the current state of its operations is unacceptable. If the current owner or management is not interested in maintaining a basic standard of service, perhaps it would be better to allow another company to take over and improve the customer experience.

I hope these issues can be addressed promptly.",1720144923,en,negative,0.5328889489173889

Encountered couple of unpleasant experiences in this petrol koisk though some good reviews are on services and friendly staff.

An incident of pump overflow from the petrol tank and the man staff blamed the design of petrol tank of the car (a Harrier). He wanted to use a normal pail demonstrating the auto-stop of the pump of the kiosk is functional. Technically this personnel has failed to practice safety confidence.

Lately few incidents were pumping RM30 to purchase a limited edition Ferrari model cars. We’ve pumped RM145 but allowed to purchase only ONE model car. The staff has always said no negotiation. This is not the first bad experience here.

We’ve been travelling across the country almost every week but this never happened in other petrol kiosks.

All consumers beware if you are a Ferrari model cars collectors when purchase petrol in this kiosk.

We’re moving forward to Industrial revolution 4.0 and IOT. Business management behind time will loose out sooner. Service qualities, good practices, clients’ satisfaction experiences are priorities forward.

We’ll never come back again to this Shell kiosk located along Jalan Haji Sirat/ Jalan Damai when we obviously don’t observe any good improvement.

The technician confirmed that the engine pipe is burned! And the main issue is 'wrong diesel' has pumped into the car. In doubt, i look back the receipt and check with my mom who's also in the car that day, but at the end it is confirmed that i pump the Primax 95 without any hiccups.

= The staff to was great and family-friendly also easy to talking to ask or talking with them (very nice)

6. Drinking chapayom
= also because I talk about stuff, let me talk about the staff who make my drinking chapayom chocolate, Maybe that was a little late but To me is worth it because the chocolate drinking was delicious

7. Place to eat and relax
= Here is the best thing about this place, After your buy snacks or drinks or just want to sit and relax, one place has a table and chairs to the side of the store

Also, I find it odd that every now and then, there is a petrol-like smell inside the water you are getting from them so always take a sip first and pour the water away if it feels off.

The main problem I have is some of card machines (particularly station 5 and 6) seem to be malfunctioning as you need many tries to get your credit card to work on it. If you encounter more than 5 failed attempts, I suggest walking into the shop and telling the staff to unlock the petrol pump so you can fill your vehicle. It is wiser to give like RM100 to the staff to hold on first (it gives them an assurance that you are not trying to get a free petrol refill and driving away without paying) before walking back out to fill your vehicle. After you are done, just walk back into the shop and pay with your card while taking back your cash.

As I walked into the store, I was immediately struck by the colorful and vibrant packaging of the snacks and drinks on the shelves. It was like being transported to a Korean market, with all kinds of unique and interesting items that I had never seen before.

I made my way to the food section and was greeted by the smell of fresh ramen and other Korean dishes being prepared in the kitchen. I decided to try the ramen, which came with a slide of cheese, and various toppings like seaweed and green onions.

The ramen broth was rich and flavorful, with just the right amount of spice. It was tender and melted in my mouth, while the egg added a nice creaminess to the dish. I was also impressed by the generous portion size and the affordable price.

In addition to the ramen, I also tried some Korean fried chicken and spicy rice cakes. The chicken was crispy and coated in a sweet and spicy sauce, while the rice cakes had a nice chewy texture and a kick of heat.

Overall, my experience at Family Mart was fantastic. The food was delicious and authentic, the atmosphere was lively and colorful, and the prices were reasonable. It was a great way to try some Korean cuisine without having to go to a fancy restaurant or travel to Korea. I would definitely recommend Family Mart to anyone looking for a fun and tasty Korean food experience.",1678171415,en,very positive,0.5641737580299377

When I arrived at the petrol station, I noticed that the fuel pump for motorcycles was full, so I chose to fill up at the pump that wasn't marked for motorcycles or vehicles. Heading towards the counter, I overheard a worker filling fuel for the motorcycle pump say in a sarcastic tone, ""The motor is in the front; the back is for the car only."" The worker also sarcastically told me that I needed to talk loudly in order for people to understand. I had no idea because there was no indication that motorcycles couldn't fill up at the pump I intended to use. In addition, there was no sign indicating that only cars could fill up there. I noticed that the worker was pretty busy at the pump, so I elected to fill up with empty oil. Furthermore, there was no sign indicating that only cars could fill up there. I noticed that the worker was pretty busy at the pump, so I elected to fill up with empty oil. That is why I am irritated, because the employee can call me in a normal tone, not a sarcastic tone.
The worker’s details : He was wearing white kopiah and around 50 years old.

I believe this petrol pump already renovated several years ago but due to the demand, the management has to consider for expansion to ensure customers are comfortable and Satisfy to come.

Retail shop inside a bit small compare to others Petronas Petrol Station and a bit crowded at the peak hour.
Additional pump also should consider to avoid any long que for customers.

Toilet also the one to consider also  since only provided one for male and one for female.

Yes: the station had 2 ATM booths which the other one I can't remember from which bank. And the entrance from Malakat have a line of street hawkers that sales 'pisang goreng' and other titbits for teas. I like Petronas cos it has multiple payment services for gas: from card to online SETEL.

However, it is not a pleasant experience during peak hours. Vehicles come from any direction to refill. Some even park right infront of the store entrance! Epic A-Hole!

Altho the motorcycles usually refill at pump number one or any pump on the left side, there are no pump specific for motorcycles. Thus, during peak hours when you get the opportunists car drivers park and refill at pumps number one, the riders scattered around the station to refill.

The staffs probably too busy to notice this, or being too afraid to take action. Ya'll know how Malaysian can be really offensive when being told what to do.

Not just that, they even force you to accept such behaviour is normal. Which is not! Driving, park and refill from opposite direction is never a 'good behaviour' but most of us look this as 'normal', right?

No matter how bad is your day, or how A-Hole is other people towards, don't loose your virtue. Be a good rider and/or driver. Changes started from ourselves.

6315,SEMABOK PERDANA,Shell,"2.20294,102.27198",Jaclyn Chua,1,"I am writing to lodge a complaint and highlight to you an incident that happened at your petrol station in MELAKA, located at Lebuh AMJ.

I was there on the 13 July at about 3.45pm to refuel my car, parked and paid at the counter. I was to receive my change of RM30 along with my Bonuslink card where i saw your cashier holding out 3 pcs of RM10s and she had placed it on the tray to collect. I was careless to leave out a piece of RM10 which at that point, i did not notice. I proceeded to my car to refuel and somehow, i got an inkling to check my wallet.

Only when i checked again, I realised i was missing a RM10 note. I checked around my car to see if I've dropped it but it was no where to be found. So as i was getting back into my car so i could clear the pump area for other cars, I noticed your cashier and her colleague looking at me as if knowing i was searching for something. They just watched me ""drive off"" when in fact i was going to repark near the counter to enquire about my money. As soon as i got down and approached the counter, without having to ask, they handed me the RM10.

What annoyed and got me disgusted was that, firstly, the cashier in the first place SHOULD HAVE called out to me when I walked away from the counter window to refuel knowing i had left the RM10. BUT SHE DID NOT.

Secondly, while i was still at the pump, which took me a good 3 minutes or so to refuel, the cashier SHOULD HAVE walked out to me to return my money. Again, SHE DID NOT.

Thirdly, as i was supposedly driving off (was going to repark), again, the cashier and her colleague COULD HAVE tried to stop me and alerted me of my money i left but they were obviously watching me drive away hoping I wouldnt claim my money.

Now i realise that it was only RM10 but this is an obvious case of total dishonesty. I am appalled and disgusted. I have been supporting Shell since i started driving 15 years ago and this one incident is an example of ""one rotten apple spoils the whole barrel"".

Please, look into this matter and please look into measures to ensure you have well trained and HONEST staff. Like i said, it was only RM10, but it could have been more. You could very well be missing petty cash as well!

Thank you.",1531812915,en,very negative,0.6997737884521484

Not too long ago they started cordoning off one of the air pumps seemingly to reserve it for motorcycles by placing a cone in the lot. The problem is, the remaining air pump is consistently faulty. Staff just do not respond whatsoever even when the hose actually snaps while in use. While waiting in line sometimes other motorcyclists will cut in to use the one not cordoned off.
Today after waiting in line there was an uncultured lady whose car was parked in the lot next to the air pump  cut into the queue by grabbing the hose before I could move my car in. While pumping she was moving around the car. Hence to give her space I continued waiting. There was no car behind me. This older Malay guy who I assumed was outlet manager walked in front of me and started gesturing at me to move my car into the lot. I waved back at him gesturing that I’m waiting. Again, still not blocking anyone. He gestured again, seemingly suggesting that I move my car in front of the air pump and drag to use the one from the cordoned off pump.  I waved him off and gestured that I was waiting for the lady. He gestured back angrily and extensively, I guess short of flipping me off  while mumbling inaudibly as my windows were up. I was taken aback. Then I realised he was heading towards his car parked under the shade. As a courteous person, I moved my car in to give way. Easy isn’t it? I would move if I’m blocking anyone. No need to be extremely rude. He drives a Mini Cooper. Fits the size of his mannerism I guess. By the way, why not you just remove the cone blocking the other air pump instead of suggesting that people park beyond the cordoned off area but use the hose anyway?

My car died at the air pump. I was waiting for my mechanic to come. I got scolded by an elderly mamak man who claimed to be the owner.

I put up the red hazard triangle on my car to notify people that my car was stuck. He took the triangle, threw it into my car, and slammed my boot shut. He touched my car and my possessions without my consent.

I told him my car could not start and that my mechanic was on the way. He said, don’t make excuses, you can’t put your car here.

First of all, I did not ‘put’ my car there. It died while I was using the pump.

Second of all, I was already waiting for my mechanic to come. He insisted that I use HIS mechanics. I brought up issue of payment. Who would pay 2 mechanics? He said it was my problem.

Third, I’m a petite female. He said that there was no excuse for me not being able to move my dead Proton Waja somewhere else.

In the end, I told him to help me move the car since he wanted it gone so badly. He did. Along with a very kind Malay man. Not sure if that was his staff.

4. On another occasion, Counter has also asked us to give RM50 and leave our credit card with them while we pump petrol. This is a huge security risk and a high risk of being scammed. Why do they need the extra rm50?

I was the car behind...the pump could reach but because of the angle, the pumps keeps clicking. I signal the lady for help and she was reluctantly strolling towards me as my side was in the sun. I asked her to hold on to the pump so I could adjust the car quickly. She said I can't stop pumping but it was not possible to pump so she insisted I pump and by that time the petrol flow stopped. Her immediate response ' tengok kamu la , suruh kamu pump' in a very rude way. I lost it..i mean, r u here to help or to blame the customer????? She still thinks she is in the right .

Petronas batu 7 is one of my favourite place. Almost 3 times a week I refill my fuel here and buy drinks at mesra.totally love it.and the greetings I receive never fails me even though you didn't reply back their good morning they don't care.they will keep greet you without fail until today. But what makes me so disappointed was the lack of accountability from one of a lady staff in her mid 40's I guest who was a cashier at around 5:30pm on 13/3/2020. I gave her rm100. I ask her to punch rm20. She gave back rm80. No issues there. But when I fill in my tank, I didn't realize the fuel up till RM 26.90. I mean come on you will not stare at the meter.of course you will stare somewhere else or you pull the pin so you won't have to hold the gun like forever. So the pump attendant came to me and ask about how much  I gave the cashier and how much she gave me back.its all correct. So the pump attendant ask me to explain to the cashier.I said should I explain everything when it is not my fault. She ask me to go to the counter and force me to pay rm6.90. I query, this is not even my fault. Who ask you to punch rm30. You expect me to stare at the screen ka. Of course you didn't realize it. She still force me to pay rm6.90 which I reluctantly still paid today. I ask the pump attendant , it was not my fault but the cashier force me to pay.I don't like this and this ain't right. Its not about the money.its about accountabilty. The cashier made mistake and I have to pay for it. Who ask you to treat your customer like that. Please LA. Sikkan aku kenak bayar atas kesalahan nya. Tolong jangan rude. Aku harap the branch manager teach nya empun staff how to handle conflict.

Located conveniently between Sibu and Bintulu, one would expect this Petronas station to be a sanctuary for weary travelers. Instead, it's a distressing reminder of civilization's absence.

The absence of toilets at Petronas Tatau is not just an inconvenience; it's a cruel joke played on desperate bladders everywhere. It's as if they expect patrons to have the bladder control of a camel or the fortitude of a seasoned survivalist.

Forget about expecting cleanliness; that ship sailed along with the basic human necessity of relief. The once-glistening bathrooms are now dusty, desolate caverns echoing with the pained cries of neglected travelers.

It's hard to fathom how a station situated between two major destinations could neglect such a fundamental need. It's akin to building a bridge without ensuring it spans the river.

If Petronas Tatau continues to ignore the pleas of its patrons for basic facilities, it risks losing not only customers but also its reputation as a reliable pit stop.

Noteworthy to feedback this petrol station that I was here on a rainy late afternoon, nearby shoplots including the petrol station was black out having issues over their current supplying.

I reached wondering what's going on and approached a very not attentive man with bhp uniform stood in front of selling store entrance, happened this man with really black face refused to respond, asked few times only he reverted rude that service wasn't available, I offered to wait awhile in the station.

After couples of mins, I decided to leave since situation didnt get better, the station's exit was blocked with cones, I wind down window to please the man to provide exit spaces (he was the only man at the service floor since),  again he remained not attentive nor responsive,  I got off car and walked to him to make my request again, he pretended he couldn't listen.

Out of sudden the current restored at the moment, I could then get petrol filled before I leave, while I made my payment over the counter, I met another crew at the cashier counter, eventually found out that the black face rude attitude man is the Supervisor/Manager of this station.

I strongly suggest that this crew shall not be given roles/duty at the sales floor for customer relationship managing, his terrible attitude and reluctancy is so disappointing and can generate lotsa loss instead, please get someone emotionally fit for customer service line, whom would be delightful for clients to meet.

Service:
The service at this petrol station was commendable. The staff was friendly, approachable, and willing to assist with any inquiries or concerns. They efficiently handled the customers, ensuring a smooth and quick process. I appreciate their professionalism and customer-centric approach.

Facilities:
The station had well-maintained facilities, including clean restrooms and a spacious convenience store. The restrooms were regularly cleaned, and hygiene was well-maintained, making it comfortable for customers during their visits. The convenience store offered a wide range of products, from snacks and beverages to automotive supplies and basic groceries. It was convenient to find essential items without having to make an additional stop.

Fuel Availability:
The station consistently provided a variety of fuel options, including regular unleaded, premium unleaded, and diesel. I never encountered a situation where the fuel pumps were out of order or any fuel type was unavailable. This reliability is crucial for customers who depend on the station for their professionalism and customer-centric approach.

Location and Accessibility:
The petrol station is conveniently located near a major road, making it easily accessible. The spacious parking area allowed for hassle-free entry and exit, even during peak hours. The well-organized layout and clear signage guided customers efficiently, preventing any confusion.

Improvement Opportunities:
One area for improvement could be the availability of alternative fuel options, such as electric vehicle charging stations or alternative fuel types. As sustainable transportation becomes more popular, providing these options can attract a wider range of customers and contribute to a greener future.

Overall, this petrol station provided an efficient and convenient experience. The attentive service, clean facilities, and easy accessibility made it a reliable choice for my fueling needs. With a few enhancements, such as introducing eco-friendly options, this station could further elevate its offering. I would recommend this petrol station to anyone looking for a hassle-free refueling experience.",1684391961,en,positive,0.621216356754303

Then he keep saying no payment received and all thus why I showed to him my transaction ID & all. He keep denying me.

Oh my god then argued with me without saying sorry that that’s actually the machine problem & at the end GHL called them back & refunded my money & it reflected back to my ewallet.

STILL, BASIR TREATED ME LIKE I WAS WRONG THE WHOLE TIME. I demanded for apology but he raised his voice towards me, in front of everyone. What a happy experience.
