    "# Sentiment Analysis on Fuel Stations\n",
    "We have succesfully use Google Places API to retrieve all Malaysia Fuel stations' rating and review from Google Maps. This rating and review is important to determine the value of each stations and how they perform based on the market sentiment. Taking some references from ChatGPT, below are the definitions of sentiment analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentiment Analysis: A Brief Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentiment analysis**, also known as opinion mining, is the process of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text. It is widely used to determine whether a piece of text conveys a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This technique is essential for businesses, especially in analyzing customer feedback, product reviews, and social media data, to gauge public opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Sentiment Analysis Works:\n",
    "1. **Text Processing:**\n",
    "   The first step in sentiment analysis involves cleaning the text data by removing irrelevant information (e.g., special characters, stop words) and then tokenizing it into individual words or phrases. The processed text is then ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Classification:**\n",
    "   Sentiment analysis typically involves classifying text into predefined sentiment categories:\n",
    "   - **Positive** sentiment: Expresses favorable opinions or emotions.\n",
    "   - **Negative** sentiment: Shows discontent or unfavorable opinions.\n",
    "   - **Neutral** sentiment: Reflects a neutral stance without strong emotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Sentiment classification can be achieved using various methods:\n",
    "   - **Lexicon-based approach:** Relies on pre-defined dictionaries (lexicons) of words labeled with their sentiment values. For example, words like \"good\" or \"excellent\" are associated with positive sentiments, while words like \"bad\" or \"poor\" indicate negative sentiments.\n",
    "   - **Machine learning-based approach:** Uses labeled datasets to train models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or neural networks, which learn to classify sentiment from text automatically.\n",
    "   - **Pre-trained language models:** Models like BERT or GPT-3 can analyze text by capturing the context and nuances, which are often missed by traditional methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Applications of Sentiment Analysis:**\n",
    "   - **Customer feedback analysis:** Businesses use sentiment analysis to assess customer opinions about their products or services.\n",
    "   - **Market research:** It helps understand market trends and consumer preferences.\n",
    "   - **Social media monitoring:** Companies analyze social media posts to track brand reputation and public perception.\n",
    "   - **Political analysis:** Sentiment analysis can be used to measure public sentiment about political issues or candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sentiment Analysis Tools:\n",
    "Some popular tools for sentiment analysis include:\n",
    "- **TextBlob:** A simple Python library that calculates sentiment polarity and subjectivity.\n",
    "- **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner):** Designed for sentiment analysis of social media texts, handling emojis, slang, and capitalization effectively.\n",
    "- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** A more comprehensive library for various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges in Sentiment Analysis:\n",
    "- **Sarcasm and irony:** These can be difficult to detect, as they may use positive words to convey a negative meaning.\n",
    "- **Context:** Words that carry different sentiments in different contexts require advanced models to interpret them accurately.\n",
    "- **Ambiguity:** Words or phrases with multiple meanings can pose a challenge, particularly in short texts like tweets.\n",
