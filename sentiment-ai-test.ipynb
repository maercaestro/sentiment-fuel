    "# Using OpenAI API to Peform Recommendations Based on Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "We are already at the age of AI. Bringing the sentiment score only is not enough. Yes, we have the insights, but what good is insights if we don't have any good actions to follow through? With the availability of LLM, we can use it's power to generate recommendations for us based on the sentiment analysis that we have done. With this, we can provide prescriptive analytics and bring more value to our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a prototype to test whether we can use OpenAI API to generate recommendations for each sentiment analysis that we have done on petrol stations. The objective is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The test the feasability of the concept - using OpenAI API to generate recommendations for each sentiment analysis\n",
    "2. To track the usage of tokens during recommendation generation and ultimately the cost\n",
    "3. Serves as testing platform before moving on to web applications - streamlit web app"
